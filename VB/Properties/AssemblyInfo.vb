' Sometimes it's necessary to specify a way of calculating summaries that is
' different from the default one. Assume you don't want to take into account cells
' with no data when calculating summaries. It's possible to accomplish this task
' using two events: use the GridView.CustomSummaryCalculate
' (ms-help://MS.VSCC.v90/MS.VSIPCC.v90/DevExpress.NETv8.2/DevExpress.XtraGrid/DevExpressXtraGridViewsGridGridView_CustomSummaryCalculatetopic.htm)
